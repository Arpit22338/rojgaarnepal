Perform a comprehensive skills gap analysis:

CURRENT STATE:
- Current Job Title: ${currentTitle || 'Student/Unemployed'}
- Current Skills: ${Array.isArray(currentSkills) ? currentSkills.join(', ') : currentSkills}
- Years of Experience: ${yearsExperience || 0}
- Education Level: ${education || 'Not specified'}

TARGET STATE:
- Desired Job Title/Role: ${targetRole}
${targetIndustry ? `- Target Industry: ${targetIndustry}` : ''}
- Target Timeline: ${timeline || '6 months'}

Provide a comprehensive analysis including:

1. SKILL MATCH PERCENTAGE - How ready they are for the target role

2. TRANSFERABLE SKILLS - Current skills that apply to the target role

3. MISSING SKILLS with:
   - Priority level (high/medium/low based on how commonly required)
   - Estimated learning time
   - Recommended resources (courses, books, projects)

4. LEARNING ROADMAP divided into phases based on their timeline:
   - Phase titles
   - Skills to learn in each phase
   - Specific milestones and checkpoints

5. INTERMEDIATE ROLES - Positions they could apply for NOW with current skills

6. ACTIONABLE TIPS - Specific advice for their transition

Be specific, practical, and encouraging. Focus on actionable steps.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON object (no markdown, no code blocks, no extra text).
Return in JSON format.
